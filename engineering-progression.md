# Engineering Roles

## Role and Career Path distinctions

Before an Engineer enters a leadership role, be it technical or organizational, the above diagram and below descriptions indicate the level of skill and ability that has been demonstrated before finding themselves deciding between becoming a _Lead Engineer_ or a _Engineering Manager_, or between becoming a _Principal Engineer_ or an _Architect_.  In each of these positions that land as a result of the fork in the road, the critical difference is not in capabilities of the person considering the role, but in what is expected of them in each role. As such, it's important that the distinction of the differences between the roles is clear, not merely the expectation of the role itself.

### _Lead Engineer_ vs. _Engineering Manager_

* __Engineering Managers__ are responsible for the organization of a group of technical people around execution and delivery of software. This means their primary repsonsibility is managing people, process, discussions, meetings, and time. While they are technically skilled and able to accomplish the same kind of work as a Lead Engineer, their primary responsibility is for managing the organization. That does not mean they may not sometimes or often play the _Lead Engineer_ role within their group or their project, but it does mean their _responsibility and expectations_ are organizational, not technical.

* __Lead Engineers__ are responsible for the organization of the technical approach to implementing solutions. Being a Lead Engineer absolutely requires working and organizing people around a technical initative, ensuring the people of the appropriate skill level are tasked to the work before them, and that the work itself is clear and understood, and their team mates are technically supported by them. While often _Lead Engineers_ will play a part in developing organizational processes, helping organize people similar to an _Engineering Manager_ the primarily _responsibility and expectation_ is around the technology and the technical approach by which a solution is being solved, and the ability to scale the execution of an implementation across a group of people through coordinated design and execution not necessarily around the organization of the group. _Lead Engineers_ are also expected to play effective supporting roles in projects they are not leading.


### _Architect_ vs. _Principal Engineer_

esayle: I'm assuming that you're going to add a section like the previous distinction here.

* [Senior Engineering](#senior-engineering)
* [Engineering Management](#engineering-management)


## Software Engineer / System Engineer ##

*Note*:  Coming in the door, if a software engineer is fresh,
and/or young in his/her career we should assume that these skills are
not necessarily present and that they will need mentoring to develop
the skills outlined below.

### Solution Complexity ###

* Implement solutions whose complexity are at the scale single blocks of logic (e.g methods, functions, and procedures, queries)
* Implement solutions whose complexity involves integrating an navigating several components within an application.
* Implement additional components that fit into a larger pre-defined structure
* Implement solutions on top of existing or legacy code of afore mentioned complexity
* Diagnose bugs and implement fixes of nominal complexity
* Refactor unsustainably implemented code as encountered in the code base
* Demonstrate separation of concerns within their implementation
  (e.g. functions/methods/procedures, queries, user interface
  implementations are rarely broken down, with clear blocks of logic)
* Recognize the use of software design patterns relevant to your area of focus

### Technical Fluency ###

* Solve problems using essential idioms involving one or two technologies (e.g. core unix tool, sql proficiency, idioms relevant to programming languages, user interface components, web interface components)
* Develop a deeper understanding of one or two technologies beyond superficial usage (e.g. peeking behind the curtain with ruby, rails, query execution, browser rendering, OS and/or platform understanding, etc)
* Iterate and improve upon implementations given feedback
* Triage and diagnose bugs and application issues
* Create tests to capture essential implementation expectations
* Demonstrate understanding of the application lifecycle: considerations for logging, debugging and managing the application in its run-time state.
* Provide design documentation for the scope of implementation without having to implement the full solution first

### Leadership Skills ###

* Receive mentorship well and demonstrate growth
* Contribute to larger projects when playing a supporting role on collaborative initiatives

### Team Skills ###

* Submit work for peer review and receive constructive feedback
* Participate in reviewing the work of peers and provide constructive feedback
* Demonstrate ownership over the success of applications
* Recognize and communicate need for additional support
* Communicate status on tasks and progress effectively

* Collaborate effectively with other technical groups within the organization
* Participate in technical discussions

### Typical Years of Experience ###

* 0 - 3 years

--------

## Senior Software Engineer / Senior System Engineer ##

In addition to the skills expected of a _Software Engineer / System Engineer_

### Solution Complexity ###

* Implement solutions whose complexity can span an entire application and integrations with other applications.
* Able to translate a problem statement into a well defined application or series of components demonstrating software design best practices.
* Evolve the code base in substantial ways that increase simplicity, enable flexibility or drive new features, while still maintaining good software design principals
* Effective contributor within code bases accross multiple business applications
* Diagnose bugs that may span multiple applications or services and drive cross application fixes
* Proactively make use of software design patterns relevant to your
  area of focus

### Technical Fluency ###

* Provide constructive technical feedback when reviewing the work of peers
* Work effectively with technologies adjacent to the their application demonstrating holistic ownership and initiative
* Provide design documentation for the scope of implementation with sufficient thoroughness that the implementation can be handed off to 1-2 other engineers.
* Develop knowledge beyond core competency.
* Navigate and become rapidly productive within unfamiliar code bases
* Rapidly engage with new technologies due to deep, productive exposure several technological tool sets.
* Undaunted when needing to work across multiple technologies.

### Leadership Skills ###

* Provide mentorship for _Software Engineers / System Engineers_, interns or new hires
* Communicate effectively with _non-technical_ business partners

### Team Skills ###

# Senior Engineering

## Lead Engineer ##

In addition to the skills expected of a _Senior Software Engineer /
Senior Systems Engineer_

### Solution Complexity ###

* Understand multiple proposed solutions by Engineers and critically evaluate the merits of each solution to then synthesize them into a course of action (evaluate technical choices)
* Ensure that technical complexity is decomposed such that it can be distributed throughout the team reflecting individual technical abilities (ensuring the work can doled out matches the skills at the table, resource matching?)
